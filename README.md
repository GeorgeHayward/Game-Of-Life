# Game-Of-Life
My implementation of Conway's Game of Life. A cellular automata which creates complexity from simple rules. Further functionality (grid size, grid draw, pause / play) / optimization will be added soon.

The project contains 3 python files:
cell: this class represents each individual live or dead cell on the grid. 
grid: the grid provides the functionality / rules of GOL.
UI: displays the current state of the grid. 

This is a basic version of GOL with minimal features / optimization. More will be added soon.
